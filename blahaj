CYBER CENTURION FULL CHECKLIST 2023 (incomplete)

•	Then you have two ways to gain points:
o	Actively (terminal or gui but requres effort)
o	Passively (uninstalling apps or games and letting updates run)

[These are how to gain points split into Active and Passive]
-	1. Install firewall 
o	 Open terminal and type command - “sudo apt install gufw” 
	This installs the graphical user interface firewall and should look like this when opened:
o	Once installed turn it on (this should get you points) and then set the incoming to reject and outgoing to allow (secure office settings)
o	EXTRA STEP: Check in the ports section for any unwanted ports open and close them

 

-	2. Uninstalling things – scroll down for more detail 
o	Command to use: “sudo apt autoremove appname” for example if you’re removing wireshark it would be “sudo apt autoremove wireshark” (for older Operating systems it is “sudo apt remove wireshark”)

-	PAM files (complicated and is done through the terminal. This changes rules on when to change passwords or how long a user can use a password. Do this after everything else in case it changes your password access in the GUI)
o	Cd /etc/pam.d
o	Sudo apt install libpam-cracklib
o	Sudo nano common-password
o	Change line with pan_unix.so remember to 5 “remember=5”
o	Change line with pam_unix.so minlen to 8
o	Add line with pam_cracklib.so “ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1” to end of thine
o	Sudo nano ../login.defs
o	Scroll to PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
o	Set PASS_MIN_DAYS to 10
o	Set PASS_WARN_AGE to 7
o	Sudo nano common-auth
o	ADD THIS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE >>
	auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5 onerr=fail unlock_time=1800
		((deny sets failed login attempts))
-	SSH config
o	IF REQUIRED -> make an ssh server if not already on the system
	

-	File permissions
o	Correct file permissions :
•	Sudo chmod -R 444 /var/log
•	Sudo chmod 440 /etc/passwd
•	Sudo chmod 440 /etc/shadow
•	Sudo chmod 440 /etc/group
•	Sudo chmod -R 444 /etc/ssh
o	Insecure file permissions 
•	To the root of a server local file or passwd file
•	Chmod -w or -r or -x
•	W means write
•	R means read
•	X means executable


//Passive
	
-	1 . Updates + Settings - GUI
o	Check for security updates + security setting changes - type settings into the search applications 
o	(e.g Daily updates, auto updates, updating ssh or firefox etc)
o	Run update (do this lunch period)

-	2 . User accounts and admins administration - GUI
o	Remove unwanted accounts + files
o	Add the new account/user group ((if READ ME asks)) – ((to make group command -> groupadd))
o	Remove non approved admins
o	Make sure admins are admins
o	Change passwords to more secure passwords
o	Remove guest account access - /etc/lightdm/users.conf

-	3. Firefox Settings
o	Change preferences (( e.g no cookies, blocking stuff, warning etc ))
o	Sidenote : Stop receiving bad cookies -> Sysctl -n net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies


//UNINSTALLING AND UNWANTED SERVICES
To delete stuff in general -> “sudo apt autoremove appname”

// Unwanted/Non-vital services ((remember to check the README before deleting, you will LOSE POINTS IF YOU DELETE NEEDED APPS. If unsure, look it up online)) :
-	Ftp (check if requred) (( use command -> sudo apt-get remove pure-ftpd ))
-	Mysql (check if requred)
-	Samba (check if requred)
-	filezilla
-	telnet
-	apache
-	Nginx (check if requred)
-	Netcat
-	John 
-	Nmap
-	Netcat 
-	Wireshark
-	Hydra
-	Mail – postfix
-	games
-	generally app folders are found in /etc/ - CHECK IF YOU NEED IT before you delete

// Media + Hidden files 
Use this command to find a file -> 
-	sudo locate *insert file* 
((remember to add *. in front of the file type, if searching for a file type))
Use command to delete media files -> 
-	"rm *insert file*"
-	File example: .jpg, .mp3, .png, .mov, .mp4, .jpeg ((if you look for .png files and there are loads some of those are for app icons so don’t delete those ones))
-	Delete files called password.txt, members.txt, users.txt etc if it looks suspicious.

// Commands guide
(if you don’t know a command either ask or use the internet, you can always search things up!)
-	Within terminal – for copy + paste use “shift + control + C” to copy and “shift + control + V” to paste
-	“ls” = list – this lists everything in the directory you are currently in inside terminal
-	“cd” = change directory – this command followed by a file location moves you to another directory in the filesystem. “cd ..” lets you go back a directory in the filesystem
-	“sudo apt install ____” -  installs any app you type after the command (if it exists)
-	 visudo - Only main user (you) can use sudo (or only specified accounts!)“locate ____” – this works on ubuntu to locate files that you are looking for.

//LEARN LINUX

-	The best tip you can get for cyber centurion is to get to know linux
-	Research it online or you can watch videos
o	Great video that is in ubuntu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVxkTqLoyGY
o	Learn about virtual machines and install some: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX75Z-4MEoM
-	HTB academy has some good starter courses that are free and can teach you about different aspects of linux. Select their defensive courses and they also have a free online virtual machine so have a go with that! https://academy.hackthebox.com/
